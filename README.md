# html-css-cheatsheet-starting

This is my own cheatsheet, made to help with important HTML and CSS tags.  It was written as my first web page (of the millenium), and it was organized to help give me the important tags I need first.  I suspect many people do a similar organization, but that kind of organization often doesn't quite meet my own brain's needs priority.
